# Welcome

OpenPecha is an :material-note-text-outline: etext and :material-tag-outline: annotations store made available on GitHub and through a set of APIs. 

The projectâ€™s primary aim is to facilitate the collection, proofreading, and enrichment of etexts by leveraging language technology and collaboration.
