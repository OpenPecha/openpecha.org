# OpenPecha Data on GitHub

OpenPecha's collection of e-texts on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenPecha-Data) is contained in more than 14,000 repositories. Each repo contains free open-source Tibetan text files in the [OpenPecha format (OPF)](/data/opf-format.md), and in some cases aligned translations. 

Most repos contain individual texts, and some contain collections. These collections include corpuses, such those created to train AI and machine translation models, and collections of texts, such as various editions of the Kangyur and Tengyur.

Individual repos are given OpenPecha IDs. To see what is indie the repos, visit the pinned repos and browse or search for the texts or collections you are looking for.
