# Building BDRC’s Tibetan E-text Corpus

## A BDRC / Google Books Collaborative Project

Support from various funders has enabled BDRC to enter new frontiers in the areas of cultural preservation and digital technology. As the leading digital Buddhist library for more than twenty years, BDRC has a uniquely significant collection of Tibetan texts and serves as a repository for endangered Tibetan cultural heritage materials. 

In 2019, Google invited BDRC to its campus in Sunnyvale to deliver a talk, meet its engineers, and discuss Tibetan computing, digital books, and language tools. From this initial meeting, BDRC and Google began working together to create e-texts from BDRC scans acquired in Tibetan communities. Supported by a $10,000 credit from Google, BDRC began experimenting using Google’s cutting-edge OCR (optical character recognition) engine to generate machine-readable texts from digital images of texts. Now, a renewed partnership with Google Books promises to transform BDRC’s scanned image library into a dataset of approximately 4 billion words, about the size of the English version of Wikipedia. Such a vast dataset will make it possible to develop crucial Tibetan-language digital tools that have long been taken for granted in other languages. For the first time, Tibetan search engines, reading and literacy tools, writing and publishing industries, and translation and lexicography projects will have access to the resources they need to bring the Tibetan language into the modern age.



## Applications of the Dataset

**Search Engines**

The dataset generated by the partnership with Google—combined with the work that the BDRC team did in 2020 on lexical resources—will allow corporations to build functional Tibetan search engines. Surprisingly, current search engines fail to retrieve useful results when used to search for Tibetan words. This is because Tibetan is a so-called continuous script language where words are not separated by spaces. Thus, search engines don’t know where words start or end and can’t separate relevant and irrelevant results. **Not being able to rely on Google is difficult to imagine, but this is the situation for average Tibetans. They don’t have easy access to massive amounts of information in their native language and many feel backwards because of this.

With proper search engines, Tibetans will have information at their fingertips and will be able to learn new skills, gain confidence, progress in their careers, understand the world better, not have to rely on Chinese and English as much, and become part of the 21st century. 

**Reading & Literacy**

The dataset will also help improve literacy among Tibetan speakers by laying the foundation for Tibetan reading assessment software and digital reading aides.

In major languages, there is reading material for every age and reading level. In addition, companies like Lexile and Scholastic use AI to assess the reading level of vast amounts of content, so that parents and teachers can choose the right book or text for children by age and reading level. Because Tibetan doesn’t have this, Tibetan children are often given books far above their reading level. This makes learning to read harder and less enjoyable. In the not-too-distant future, Tibetan readers will also benefit from this.

The tools available to speakers of major languages help readers consume texts above their level. For example, e-readers have embedded dictionaries to help look up words, text-to-speech engines to read along with, and other reading aides. These tools build confidence. Most Tibetans are native Tibetan speakers, yet they prefer to read in Chinese or English as there are tools to support them. This should change when these technologies are developed for the Tibetan language.

**Writing & Publishing**

The dataset will allow corporations and startups to create writing tools like spellcheckers, grammar checkers, and style checkers. Without these, most of us wouldn’t feel confident writing. The average Tibetan, who doesn’t have access to these tools in Tibetan, also isn’t confident writing** **in their own language. The result is that most Tibetans don’t write, and even if they do, they don’t write well. In fact, in Tibetan communities in India, there is a common idea that class 12 students can’t write a job application in Tibetan or a letter to their mother. Good writing technology will change that.

Having machine readable versions of the BDRC collection will save editors and publishers who wish to publish them a lot of time preparing text. They will also be able to compare different editions of books and create critical editions.

The dataset will also form the basis of analytical tools to help publishers, online book distributors, and authors use analytics to better sell books. Other tools will help summarize books, classify books by topic, and provide search on publisher sites, offer book recommendations based on readers’ behavior, and conduct sentiment analysis on reader feedback.

**Translation & Lexicography**

This project—along with tools that can now be built on top of it—will allow for the creation of Tibetan language CAT (computer assisted translation) tools. This in turn will usher in the rapid translation of foriegn language texts into Tibetan and vastly increase the amount of content available in Tibetan.

In the past 20 years, translators started using CAT tools. This improved translation efficiency by anywhere from 40-80 percent. Current state-of-the-art, tailored adaptive suggestions powered by Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is 3-5 times faster than previous technology. These tools are made possible by AI models trained on combinations of bi-lingual and single language datasets. BDRC’s etext dataset will go a long way to help create these tools in Tibetan.

In terms of lexicography, good dictionaries are at the heart of education and literacy. Every Tibetan student will tell you that looking up a word starts a long loop of having to look up other words to understand the definition etc. This is an issue English speakers rarely encounter since technology has long been used to pick the useful example sentences and to control the vocabulary used to define words. The Tibetan corpus built with this project will level the playing field for dictionary builders by making the best lexicographical tools available for the Tibetan language. For example, the corpus will be made available on Sketchegine, the tool that Oxford, Cambridge, and Collins dictionaries use.

**How This Affects Technology Startups and Freelancers**

Today and tomorrow’s technology leverages AI to turn data and information into commodities. The bulk of intelligent or smart products and service automation rely on language technology. Predictions for the coming 10 years of AI innovation[^1] forecast a symbiosis between big tech on one side and small startups and specialized freelancers on the other. Big companies train powerful yet blunt foundation models on massive amounts of data, which they then rent to startups and freelancers who fine-tune them with custom data for specialized purposes.

BDRC’s corpus will be usable at both levels. Since it is open, big companies will be able to include it when training foundation models, and freelancers will be able to curate and use specific subsets of the data. 

Both BDRC’s dataset and models trained on it will open the doors to countless possibilities for Tibetan freelancers. Smart technology, innovative publication formats, advertisements, recommendations, and the like will become accessible to technology startups. 

As AI requires human expertise, a thriving data-driven technology economy will in turn create employment for literate Tibetans. For example, graduate students, who wouldn’t otherwise have many job opportunities, can work as translators and annotators to create and fine-tune training data. In fact, in the past few years, a few training data creation projects (most likely for Bing) have employed many university graduates to create translation training data.

BDRC’s new dataset will greatly contribute to this budding industry.

**A Case Study**

The first case of big tech and specialized freelancer symbiosis is Bing Translator. Bing’s foundation model for translation from Tibetan was trained on publicly available data and freelancers are welcome to fine-tune it with their own dictionaries and data and then sell the resulting translation engine for profit. Bing is decent when translating everyday language, but clearly wasn’t trained on native literature. Judging from current translation results, it seems that the main literary dataset it was trained on was the Bible in Tibetan.

_(Bing’s current effort at translating the title “[A Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattvacary%C4%81vat%C4%81ra)”.)_

BDRC’s e-text corpus combined with other bilingual corpus projects will provide Bing Translate with the data needed to significantly improve its quality. Tech startups and freelance translators will be able to use their own data to fine-tune Bing translation engine.

In conclusion, in the same way that the impact of BDRC scans had a huge impact on cultural preservation, education, and publishing, the BDRC’s e-text corpus will have an enormous impact on innovative technology and the Tibetan language industry of tomorrow.
