## Who is OpenPecha for?
- **Text Owners**. Text owners are groups of people who are linked to a particular Tibetan text through their history, culture, and heritage, and have a continuing relationship that brings the text into living, communicative contexts; this includes, for example, living monastic traditions that study the particular texts of their Buddhist lineage or research projects who specialize in a given collection
