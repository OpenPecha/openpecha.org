# HOW-TO: Styling

This instruction covers how to use the in-built styling and formatting system.

## Background

Typically, there will arise the need for publishing the text that is being translated. Within BuddhistCAT a system is provided for making publication as seamless as possible.

## Instructions

The styling classes as per the below reference, will be added to string pairs in Transifex whenever relevant (e.g. the pair is a title) by clicking the `Edit context` button in the translation view. Then in the opening text field, add the appropriate style class.
