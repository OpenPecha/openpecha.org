# HOW-TO: Annotation

This instruction covers how to annotate texts in the translation view. There are four parts:

- Issues
- Comments
- Footnotes
- Endnotes

## Background

There are many different ways in which texts can be annotated. Some are visible in the final publication, and some are not. These are all covered in this instruction.

## Instructions for Issues

Issues are a useful way for the translation team to communicate about various aspects of the project. Issues can be found from the `Comments` tab (next to `Suggestions` and `Glossary`) in the translation view in Transifex.

Issues is best used for communication between translators and reviewers/editors.

## Instructions for Comments

Comments are a useful way for the translation team to communicate about various aspects of the project with. Comments can be found from the `Comments` tab (next to `Suggestions` and `Glossary`) in the translation view in Transifex.

Comments is best used for communication between translators and pandiatas.

## Instructions for Footnotes

Footnotes are automatically placed on at the bottom of each page when the text is published. Footnotes are numbered automatically.

Footnotes can be added inline to any translated segment using the following format. 

`[FOOTNOTE: the content of the footnote]` or `[FOOT: the content of the footnote]`

So for example, if the translated segment otherwise is: 

`I pay homage to Manjushri`

Then with a footnote for the term homage, it becomes: 

`I pay homage [FOOTNOTE: footnote content comes here] to Manjushri`

**NOTE:** The format must be exactly like in the above example, but it does not matter if capital letters are used or not for declaring it.

## Instructions for Endnotes

Endnotes are automatically placed on at the end of the text when it is published. Endnotes are numbered automatically.

Endnotes can be added at the end of any segment using the following format. 

`[ENDNOTE: the content of the footnote]` or `[END: the content of the footnote]`

So for example, if the translated segment otherwise is: 

`I pay homage to Manjushri`

Then with an endnote for the term homage, it becomes: 

`I pay homage [ENDNOTE: endnote content comes here] to Manjushri`

**NOTE:** The format must be exactly like in the above example, but it does not matter if capital letters are used or not for declaring it.
