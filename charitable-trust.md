# OpenPecha Charitable Trust

In an age of accelerating technology and rising rates of anxiety, depression, and social disconnection in New Zealand and globally, the OpenPecha Charitable Trust aims to bridge this gap by making Buddhist wisdom accessible to address the root causes of modern suffering.

## Purpose

The purpose of the Trust is to empower communities to learn, live, and share Buddhist wisdom through digital technologies while ensuring its authentic representation in digital spaces. In particular the Trust will:

- Develop and maintain open-source software solutions and digital platforms that make accessible Buddhist teachings particularly relevant to contemporary challenges
- Hold intellectual property rights to all software, digital content, and data created under its auspices, while making these resources available through appropriate open-source and open-access licenses
- Provide technical support and training to Buddhists in New Zealand and around the world so they can effectively use technology in their study, practice, and community activities
- Collaborate with other projects to digitize, preserve, and make accessible important textual and cultural resources
- Partner with New Zealand and international educational and health institutions to develop resources combining Buddhist approaches to wellbeing such as mindfulness, compassion, and wisdom, with contemporary understanding of mental health
- Provide opportunities for youths to develop a healthy relationship with technology while cultivating inner qualities essential for navigating an increasingly complex digital world
- Support initiatives that further the Trust's mission of bringing proven approaches to inner peace, ethical clarity, and genuine happiness into the digital age for everyone's benefit

## Principles

The Trust is committed, in attaining its purposes, to:

- Respecting and implementing the dual heritage of the partners of Te Tiriti o Waitangi (the Treaty of Waitangi), recognizing the complementary relationship between indigenous wisdom traditions and Buddhist approaches to inner wellbeing
- Embodying kaitiakitanga (guardianship) in preserving and sharing Buddhist wisdom that offers timeless insights for addressing modern challenges faced by New Zealand and global communities
- Honoring the unique role Buddhist traditions can play in an era of technological acceleration, offering pathways to balance outer progress with inner peace
- Maintaining the highest ethical standards in the development and application of AI and digital technologies, guided by Buddhist principles of non-harm, compassion, and mindful awareness
- Fostering collaboration between traditional wisdom holders and contemporary innovators
- Preserving the integrity and authenticity of Buddhist teachings integrated in digital technologies
- Promoting open-source solutions and open data principles while maintaining appropriate stewardship of intellectual property

## Activities

### Pecha: Mobile App and Web Platform

**Description:** OpenPecha develops and maintains Pecha, a comprehensive mobile app and web platform that makes authentic Buddhist texts, teachings, and practice plans freely accessible. This platform includes searchable texts, translations, commentaries, guided meditation instructions, and structured practice plans for various levels of experience. Users can access both traditional scriptural resources and practical implementation guides for meditation, mindfulness, and compassionate action in daily life.

**Who Benefits:** Buddhist practitioners, scholars, students, educators, mental health professionals, and anyone interested in Buddhist wisdom benefit from this service globally, including throughout New Zealand. Buddhist centres gain access to authentic teachings to support their communities. Educational institutions can incorporate these resources into curricula. Individuals facing anxiety, depression, or seeking inner balance in our digital age find accessible wisdom traditions to support wellbeing and mindfulness practices. While serving global audiences, we provide dedicated support for New Zealand's Buddhist community.

**Who is Involved:** The platform is developed and maintained by our global open-source community with coordination from the OpenPecha Charitable Trust. Most technical development is carried out overseas, funded by the Trust, while we collaborate with New Zealand Buddhist organisations for local implementation and feedback. International teams handle the primary technical work, with contributions from New Zealand volunteers who provide content expertise and testing. This international approach allows us to leverage specialised skills worldwide while ensuring the platform serves New Zealand needs.

**Where it Takes Place:** The majority of development work occurs internationally, with funds directed to teams with specialised expertise in Buddhist digital technologies. Implementation support is provided to Buddhist centres globally, including dedicated assistance for New Zealand communities through both virtual channels and occasional in-person sessions. While most resources are allocated overseas, we maintain direct engagement with New Zealand Buddhist centres to ensure effective local utilisation of these internationally developed resources.

### Pecha Tools: Text Processing and Translation Tools

**Description:** OpenPecha provides Pecha Tools, specialised text processing applications that help Buddhist communities worldwide, including in New Zealand, digitise, translate, and share important teachings. These tools include OCR for Buddhist scripts, translation editors, and publishing tools that allow even small centres to create high-quality digital resources. Our tools incorporate AI assistance while maintaining human oversight to ensure authenticity, making the digitisation process accessible to non-technical users.

**Who Benefits:** Diverse Buddhist communities globally benefit, particularly those with limited technical resources. Buddhist centres can digitise and share their teachings. Translation groups working across languages can create multilingual materials. Mental health professionals can adapt Buddhist content for wellbeing programs. Students and researchers gain access to tools for academic study of Buddhist texts. New Zealand's Buddhist community benefits from these globally developed tools through dedicated support and adaptation for local needs.

**Who is Involved:** The tools are developed primarily by overseas teams funded by the Trust, leveraging international expertise in Buddhist text processing technologies. We direct most resources to specialised digitisation, proofreading, and translation work conducted by experts in Asia and around the world. This international allocation of funds ensures the highest quality outcomes while still providing training and implementation support for New Zealand users. The Trust coordinates between local implementation and the overseas development teams that receive the majority of funding.

**Where it Takes Place:** Tool development and specialised digitisation work occurs internationally, with most funds directed overseas to teams with relevant expertise. The tools themselves are cloud-based and accessible worldwide, with support materials specifically adapted for New Zealand users. While development resources are primarily allocated internationally, we provide implementation support to New Zealand Buddhist centres through online training and occasional local workshops, ensuring that internationally funded work serves local communities effectively.

### Pecha Data: Making Buddhist Knowledge Accessible

**Description:** OpenPecha develops Pecha Data, a comprehensive initiative making authentic Buddhist wisdom accessible to technical communities and wider audiences globally. We create and publish high-quality datasets on platforms like HuggingFace and Wikimedia, develop APIs for technology developers, and provide AI models trained on authentic Buddhist content. This service ensures that Buddhist knowledge is properly represented in digital spaces and available for integration into applications, research, and AI systems worldwide.

**Who Benefits:** Technology developers around the world, including in New Zealand, gain access to well-structured Buddhist datasets and APIs to build applications. AI researchers can utilise ethically-sourced training data related to Buddhist wisdom. The general public benefits from improved representation of Buddhist knowledge in digital platforms they use daily. Educational technology creators can incorporate authentic content into learning tools. While serving global needs, these resources particularly support New Zealand's technology sector in building locally relevant applications.

**Who is Involved:** The majority of our funding supports international teams who create high-quality datasets, APIs, and AI models, with oversight from Buddhist scholars to ensure authenticity. This overseas allocation of resources leverages specialised expertise not readily available in New Zealand, while still maintaining engagement with New Zealand's tech community through dedicated outreach and implementation support. The Trust directs funds primarily to international development while coordinating with local communities to ensure the resulting resources meet New Zealand needs.

**Where it Takes Place:** Dataset development and technical infrastructure creation occurs internationally, with most funds directed overseas to specialised teams. While development primarily happens abroad, we provide implementation support globally with particular attention to fostering adoption within New Zealand's technology and Buddhist communities. This approach allows us to maximise impact by focusing resources on international expertise while ensuring benefits reach New Zealand users through targeted support and adaptation.
