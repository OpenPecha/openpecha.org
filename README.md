# OpenPecha
OpenPecha is a freely available platform for storing and managing etexts and annotations. It's accessible through GitHub and a suite of APIs, allowing for easy integration with other tools.

## Collaborative Buddhist Knowledge Management
OpenPecha's core mission is to streamline the process of collecting, proofreading, and enriching etexts and annotations. It achieves this by combining the power of language technology with collaborative workflows.

## Powerful Data Exchange and Publishing
The project utilizes the OPF data model alongside tools like the toolkit's annotation transfer. This combination creates a robust pivot format, facilitating seamless data exchange and dynamic publishing capabilities.

## Real-World Application
OpenPecha serves as the foundation for the Pecha ecosystem, including [Pecha Tools](https://pecha.tools/), [Pecha Data](https://github.com/cowprotocol/app-data), and the [Pecha web app](https://pecha.org/).
