# OpenPecha

OpenPecha is open etext and annotation store made available on GitHub and through a set of APIs. 

The projectâ€™s primary aim is to facilitate the collection, proofreading, and enrichment of etexts by leveraging language technology and collaboration.

The OPF data model combined with tools such as annotation transfer turn the store as a powerful pivot format for data exchange and dynamic publishing.

A real life application of the project is the pipeline of [Pecha Tools](https://pecha.tools/), [Pecha Data](https://github.com/PechaData) and the [Pecha](https://pecha.org/) web app.
