## What is OpenPecha?

As we’ve touched on above, a truly modern digital publication is never a “final”, static image. Instead, it’s a living, breathing entity in constant communication with its community. The Tibetan digital landscape needs an open space where data can be gathered; on offer to anyone in the community; and open to collaborative curation and annotation, while also responding to users’ needs. This kind of public-domain, digital publishing will be familiar to anyone who’s heard of Project Gutenburg and its Distributed Proofreaders platform, and the offshoots they’ve inspired (GITenberg, WikiBooks, etc.). From a practical standpoint, that means we need a tool that imports from, and exports to, formats common to users who access Tibetan texts; that transfers annotations from one base text to another; and that offers an organized, systematic catalog of titles, versions, annotations, and related texts. This data-first maintenance and interoperability are the core aims of OpenPecha’s database, format, and toolkit.

First, it aims to store every available electronic representation of each text, along with all existing annotations. From there, both the texts and their annotations are downloadable; contributions are uploadable; and users can export to a variety of common formats (like EPUB and PDF). This means that texts can keep improving while not losing any of their annotations. It also allows for any NLP (Natural Language Processing), NER (Named Entity Recognition), or error-detecting models to be applied to the entirety of the corpus without interfering with existing data created by others. Finally, it gives the community of readers access to the most-current proofread ebooks that contain only the annotation layers they need, in the format of their choice. In short, the goal is to provide something that is:

- **Flexible** in application, serving a wide variety of Tibetan language professionals;
- **Durable** in that it uses free tools and platforms, with minimal maintenance;
- **Editable** at all stages of the workflow, and at every level of the document;
- **Easy-to-learn** and human-friendly for the average user;
- **Open** to anyone anywhere, providing a large catalog of texts with a wide range of annotation schema; and
- **Collaborative**, to leverage shared knowledge in a small, specialized field, and allow for crowdsourced improvements.
