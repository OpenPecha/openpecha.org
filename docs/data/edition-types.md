We can define 5 main types of edition:

## Facsimile edition (scans)

A reproduction (now usually photographic) with commentary.

## Diplomatic edition (OCR or diplomatic input in a diplomatic pecha + HFML tags)

A transcription of a single MS (no attempt to establish "best" readings), indicating as far as possible the "state" of the text in this manuscript.

## Eclectic edition

A composite text, produced by an editor by taking a line from this MS and another line from that, without the use of a single "copy" text.

## Collated edition (collation, variorum)

A work that collates all known variants of a text.

## Critical edition

An attempt to establish a "best text" through comparison of various versions (study of "variants"); the editor chooses a "copy text" (usually that of the most authoritative manuscript) and "corrects" it using the variants from other manuscripts.
