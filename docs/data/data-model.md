# OpenPecha Data Model

From a data-model perspective, OpenPecha takes its cue from BIBFRAME [Bibliographic Framework](https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/docs/bibframe2-model.html), and retains three basic levels of abstraction:

![bibframe2 & OpenPecha](/images/bibframe2op.png)

1. **Work**, as the most abstract level of a text, is the idea of the message the text is attempting to communicate;
2. **Instance** (or “Pecha” in OpenPecha terminology) is the ‘whole package’ of a work (its text and formatting and annotations); while
3. **Item** (or "View" in OpenPecha terminology) is any specific copy or version of the work that exists in the world (on a bookshelf or a user’s machine, for example).

From above, then, (2) is the base text and its moveable layers, while a version exported to a user’s machine is level (3). Here, we also define the base text as the “verbal text” — the text as the string of characters that conveys the message of the original “work”. The aim is to get a representation that is as close as possible to the original, core message the verbal text was made to communicate.17 While that includes punctuation key to the orthography and the prosody of reading out loud (in Tibetan, for example, ཚེག་s and ཤད་s), it notably does not include extraneous punctuation; formatting & layout; tables of content; or glossaries and other supplementary tools for the reader.18 These are all defined as “annotations” to the base text, and are given annotation layers.
