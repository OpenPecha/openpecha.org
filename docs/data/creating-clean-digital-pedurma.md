Steps that we have gone through preparing the opfs are as follow:

- we have ocred the pedurma and format it in opf

- we parse the bdrc outline to get image number range of the texts, pg number range of texts, title, durchen page and image range

- we parsed title and text Id from rkts outline 

- using the image number info of outlines and pagination layers, we tried to reconstruct the index of pedurma

- using the same info we annotated the durchen starting point and ending point

- after that we have serialize the annotations in html(human friendly markup language) 

- given them to our freelancer to manually check the actual table of content

- reformat the updated hfmls to opf

** Regarding the derge Google pedurma, we have transfer all the base text to Google ocred opf base and updated all the layers. But we have left the volumes which are not in derge as it as in the opf
